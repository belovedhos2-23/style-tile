		<h3>Style Tile</h3>
		<p>
			For my website design, I would like it to come across as professional, creative, and organized. The red-orange is an energetic and warm color. The sans-serif logo title creates a feeling of stability and traditionalism. These two elements combined into the logo help it to be interesting, and to communicate my desired message. The background is a stone texture, predominantly white with grey accents. The white looks clean and minimalistic, while the grey texturing adds interest and an earthy feeling to the website. Since the serif is such a iconic harbinger of traditionalism, I wanted to pair it with a body text that is modern and less formal. Hence, the sans-serif font-family of "Poiret One." 

			In conclusion, I feel that my style tile will help me to execute a website design which will successfully communicate my desired message, and will be a helpful platform to communicate with possible clients. In addition, it will be a great form to display my work.
